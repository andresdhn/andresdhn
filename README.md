## Hola! 👋

Welcome, this is where I keep my work and ideas.  

- I pretty much work entirely on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [React.js](http://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/). ⚛️
- I create decoupled web applications and API integrations.  🚀
- I'm a PWA and Jamstack advocate. 📱
- I'm an avid user of the task runner [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com). 🥤
- I write about JavaScript on [Medium](https://medium.com/@andresdhn). 🗒
- I'm also the creator of the game [gempuzzle.com](https://gempuzzle.com). 🧩
